# Dockerized Two-Tier App

This repository is an extension of the [two-tier-flask-app](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/two-tier-flask-app) repository. It demonstrates how to containerize a two-tier application using Docker and optimize the image size.

## Repository Contents

This repo contains two Dockerfiles:

1. **Dockerfile** â€“ A standard Dockerfile that creates an image of **564MB**.
2. **Dockerfile-multistage** â€“ A multi-stage build that optimizes the image size to **223MB**.

Using a multi-stage Docker build helps reduce the final image size, making it more efficient for production deployment.

## Image Scanning with Docker Scout

To ensure security and best practices, **Docker Scout** is used to scan the images.
